# Social Network Ads

### INSTALLATION

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/index.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

##
### EXECUTION

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Social-Network-Ads/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook Social_Network_Ads.ipynb
```
or
```bash
ipython notebook Social_Network_Ads.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser. You can also use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) for easy access as it already has all the packages installed.
